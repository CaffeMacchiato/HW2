Brief Overview: I mimicked the webpage to the best of my ability. I used a grid layout to organize the page, 
and played around with paddings and margins until it looked similar to the screenshots of the webpage given to us.
However, I wasn't able to figure out how to display the image "sunset.jpg" within the header, and I wasn't able to properly display the paragraph and
ul bulleted list on the side of the "coast.jpg" image and have it resize as the browser is resized.
